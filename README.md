# MusicPlayer
A Music Player built on the Electron JS Framework.

# Notes
This project is not meant to be forked or ran by others. 
I have pushed this project of mine to GitHub to create a portfolio of my work.

### Why?
This project uses an account system to sync users' playlists and spotify tokens. 
I am not intending to make this project an open project due to GDPR research for which i do not have time.
